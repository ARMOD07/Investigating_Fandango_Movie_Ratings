# Investigating_Fandango_Movie_Ratings

This project was carried out as part of an analysis of movie ratings on Fandango, an online movie rating platform. The goal was to determine whether, following Walt Hickey's October 2015 article, Fandango's rating system had evolved. By exploring the ratings data of popular films from 2015 and 2016, we compared the distributions of Fandango's ratings for these two years to see if there had been any significant changes. This project is part of the exercises provided by Dataquest, an online learning platform dedicated to data analysis and data science. It helps to deepen data analysis skills and apply statistical techniques to interpret data samples from real-world platforms
